My wife, Debby, is a rabid movie / DVD collector. A few years ago things were getting out of hand as the collection grew. At that time a catalog was started using Excel and/or OpenOffice Clac.

It's an opposrtunity for a python Sqlite database application I have been intending to take advanage of, so here is is. This is a very common kind of first database project and there is no dearth of  such apps out there - but who can resist writing their own. This is especially so because I am still learning the ins and outs of writing python applications.
